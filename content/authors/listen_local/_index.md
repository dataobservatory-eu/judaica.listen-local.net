Listen Local is an open collaboration of Reprex and the Digital Music Observatory to make local ecosystems more visible and sustainable in the era of global music streaming.  We want to ensure that visitors of a city not only hear mainstream music from the U.S. and Latin America in the stores and restaurants but also local artists, keeping some attention and money in the locality.  We want to connect local audiences with local artists in the increasingly crowded recommendations of radios and streaming services that tend to promote music only from 50-100 major cities in the world. We also help connect audiences, curators, and artists in niche genres and music scenes.
