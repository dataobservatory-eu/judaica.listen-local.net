We define Litvak music as the traditional folk music of Litvaks, or Jews with roots in the territory of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania (covering present-day Lithuania, Belarus, Latvia, the northeastern Suwałki, and Białystok regions of Poland, as well as adjacent areas of modern-day Russia and Ukraine) who used to follow a "Lithuanian" (Ashkenazi, non-Hasidic) style of life and learning, regardless of their ethnic background.  Our Listen Local Judaica Music contains recorded fixations (recordings) or audiovisual recordings of such music. Our Listen Local Judaica Music Artist contains the bibliographical, musicological, and rights management data of performers of Litvak music or composers who re-arrange as new authors of Litvak music.
